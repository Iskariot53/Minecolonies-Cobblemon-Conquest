- Adds global economy and sales/trading system implemented, relic coins based, for now at least.

- Implements replacement bottlecaps, resolving crashes caused by them. Fisher huts are now also a viable means of obtaining them. (not sifter exclusive anymore).
- Caps added to treasure loot tables (can be found in chests now, rarely)
- Implements 1k block range for spawn notifications as well as notifs themselves are now actionable again by default. (Still configurable.)
- Fixed Red Merchant causing server crashes.
- Adds tags to extend pokemon spawns into twilight forest.
- Form change fixes and well as new megas from ZA.
- re-introduces custom spawns. eliminating/downsizing the spawns of higher-tier evolutions. (re-introduces - meaning this isn't new and not subject to debate, sorry)
