Changes


- Multiple major bugs with showdown resolved, including double battles issues and form changes.
- Hyptertubes (especially larger pipe networks) should run more stable.
- Tropical colony style added.
- Re-work of Oritech and it's internal network (If you use the mod frequently MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE UPDATING, although testing has gone well)
